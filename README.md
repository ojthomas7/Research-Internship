# Research-Internship

This repository contains the files I created as part of my four week research internship position under Dr. Calum Williams. The repository is split into two folders: Main and Misc. The Main folder contains the final product of my internship: "hyperspectral_imaging.py", a file that is the culmination of all four weeks of work, and was built off of all the files in Misc. The file is well commented and documented so please view to gain an understanding of its function.

The Misc folder contains files I built whilst trying to gain an understanding of this project. It contains smaller, less well documented files with a range of files, e.g. simply turning the SuperK COMPACT emission on and off. I built a new file for each action and slowly combined them into one master file, as explained above. These may be helpful for new students/ staff trying to understand my code after having read the documentation contained in "hyperspectral_imaging.py".
